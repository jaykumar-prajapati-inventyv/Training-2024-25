# Task 3: Tabs of login & signup using HTML and CSS & To Authorization and Create user account i've used JS concepts.

## overview
This project showcases the creation of interactive Login and Signup forms using only HTML and CSS, leveraging HTML5 ```<details>``` and ```<summary>``` tags for seamless toggling without JavaScript, checkboxes, or anchors. The Login form redirects authenticated users to home.html, where a 42-second session timer automatically clears the session and redirects to index.html. Additionally, an "End Session" button allows users to manually terminate the session.

The Signup form securely stores user data in localStorage, enabling user authentication during login. This lightweight and responsive design highlights efficient user management and session handling with pure HTML and CSS, making it an innovative and portfolio-worthy project
