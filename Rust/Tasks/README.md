# Tasks
 - Welcome to my task folder! This folder is organized into two key sections to help track my progress and learning journey.

   - Assigned Tasks: This section contains all the tasks given by Ellis Sir during my internship. Each task here reflects my commitment to learning and applying new concepts under expert guidance.

   - Personal Tasks: Here, you’ll find all the tasks I’ve taken on for my personal growth and development. These tasks represent my initiative to continually learn, improve my skills, and push myself beyond the boundaries of formal assignments.

 Together, these sections showcase not only the tasks I’ve been assigned but also my dedication to self-improvement and lifelong learning.
