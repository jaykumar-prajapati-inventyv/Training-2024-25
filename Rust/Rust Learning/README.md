# Rust Learning
 - Welcome to my Rust learning folder! This repository covers a comprehensive journey through Rust, from its foundational concepts to more advanced topics. You’ll explore the basics such as data types, functions, loops, and control flow, before diving into Rust's unique features like Ownership, Reference Borrowing, and the powerful match expression. Additionally, you'll learn about Structs, Enums, and Generics that provide the flexibility to write reusable and type-safe code. 
 
 - Error handling, file operations, and an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Rust are also included, offering a full picture of what makes Rust such a robust and efficient language. This folder serves as a complete guide to help you understand and master Rust’s concepts, whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your expertise.
