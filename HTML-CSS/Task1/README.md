# Task 1: Tabs with HTML and CSS

 This project demonstrates how to create interactive tabs using only HTML and CSS. It showcases a Login and Signup form, where the forms are toggled using the HTML5 ```<details>```and ```<summary>``` tags, without relying on JavaScript or other advanced features like anchors, checkboxes, or radio buttons.

## Overview

The task demonstrates a simple tab-based interface that allows users to switch between Login and Signup forms. This is achieved by leveraging the collapsible properties of the  element and customizing its behavior using CSS.

### Features

 - Pure HTML and CSS Implementation: No JavaScript or other advanced features used.

 - Interactive Tabs: Easily toggle between Login and Signup forms.

 - Styled Forms: Clean and minimal design for the forms with centered buttons.


### HTML Structure:

  - The ```<details>``` tag is used for the collapsible behavior.

  - Buttons and input fields are styled to appear clean and modern.

### Technologies Used
