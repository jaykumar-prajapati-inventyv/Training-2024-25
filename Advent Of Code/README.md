# Advent of Code

The Advent of Code website (adventofcode.com) is an online platform that provides a series of daily programming puzzles. Each day, a new problem is released, challenging participants to solve it using any programming language of their choice. The puzzles vary in difficulty, becoming progressively harder as the month goes on.
