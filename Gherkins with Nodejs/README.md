# Cucumber with Node js

## Overview
This project is an automated testing setup using Gherkin with Node.js and Playwright for end-to-end testing of a login application. It follows a structured approach where Gherkin feature files define test scenarios in the features/ folder, and step definitions implement them. The tests/ directory contains Playwright test scripts, while test-results/ stores execution reports. The project is managed with Node.js, with dependencies handled via package.json. A server.js file is included, possibly for running a local server. Configuration files like playwright.config.js ensure smooth test execution, and documentation is available in README.md. ðŸš€
